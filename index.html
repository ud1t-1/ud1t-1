                  <h2>Early life and career </h2>
                  Elon Musk and his brother started Zip2, a software company, in 1995. In 1999 he sold it and became a millionaire. He then started X.com, which merged with the company Confinity to make PayPal. X.com was then renamed to PayPal, and he focused on growing that part of the company.[6][7] He then started SpaceX and became the CEO of Tesla.
          
                  Musk was born to a Canadian mother and a South African-Born British father in Pretoria, South Africa.[8] His parents divorced in 1980 and he mainly lived with his father in many different places in South Africa.[9] He went to Waterkloof House Preparatory School and graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. He then moved to Canada in 1988 when he was 17, after he obtained Canadian citizenship through his mother. He got it before his South African military service was to begin. He felt that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States from Canada than from South Africa.
